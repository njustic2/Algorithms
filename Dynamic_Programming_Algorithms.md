Building Bridges problem

Imagine a river with cities on either side. The cities are numbered (0, 1, 2, … n) and each city has a corresponding city on the other side of the river (has the same number, but not in the same order). All the cities want to be connected with their corresponding city across the river via a bridge. How can you compute the maximum number of bridges you can build between pairs of cities without any of the bridges crossing?

Knapsack problem

You are a renowned thief who has just broken into someone’s vault. You have a few types of items that you can steal, and each has a weight and a value. There is an unlimited supply of each type of item, but you can only carry so much weight in your bag. What is the maximum value that you can steal without exceeding the weight limit of your knapsack?
