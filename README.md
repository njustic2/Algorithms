# Algorithms
This is an algorithm Websight.
The websight starts by lunching a fucntion froma java script file called app.js
This websight uses Java Script, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, moments.js and Jquery

When that file is lunched, it uses HTML to give it its web look.

Users now have access to using the websight.
There are three main functionality of the websight
The tabs gives users a view of how the functionality works.

Tab one is Dynamic Algorithm
Tab two is Greedy Algorithm
Tab three is fibonacii Algorithm 
Tab four is for future work

Once the Dynamic Algorithm is clicked, a file that gives you a brief summary of the algorithm opens up.
The build of of the file is simple, it uses a constructor to store the properties of the Dymanic algorithm.
The arguments in the constructor are created as an array so it can handle multiple data.
After the user inputs a string of characters, numbers or special symbol, the algorithm calls the Dynamic function and then processes the user inputs to give an output.

The same process is used for Greedy Algorithm and for Fibonacci.
